# PDF Lib

Honestly, this was a product of me being bored and wondering what it would take
to generate a PDF without using external libraries. It... is... interesting to say the least.

As I progressed through the stages of wonder... I realized that there's some potential
in it.

This project is still in its early stages and is not yet ready for production use.

# Overview

Currently, you can generate a PDF programmatically via the API, or alternatively use
Razor syntax (which I think is preferrable).

By using the Razor API you can use familiar markup to generate your PDFs. All without external
dependencies on a web-browser.

Example the PDF produced via the PdfTest project: [PDF Example](./razor-test.pdf)
